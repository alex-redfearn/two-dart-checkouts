\problemname{Two Dart Checkouts}

Alex wants to get better at darts. He's great at hitting trebles but not so great at hitting doubles or doing quick maths. 
From a starting point of 501 he can reliably get down to a score of under 99. He can hit a treble with one dart but he needs two attempts at the double. 
Since Alex is bad at maths he needs help to work out which treble and then double he needs to hit with his remaining three darts.

\section*{Input}

The input will include one integer between $60$ and $98$ (inclusive).

\section*{Output}

Output a line for each possible treble and double checkout combination.
