# two-dart-checkouts
A Kata created by me! Give it a go &lt;link>

## Problem
Alex wants to get better at darts. He's great at hitting trebles but not so great at hitting doubles or doing quick maths. From a starting point of 501 he can reliably get down to a score of under 99. He can hit a treble with one dart but he needs two attempts at the double. Siince Alex is bad at maths he needs helping working out the treble and double he needs to hit to finish the game.

## Input
The input will include one integer between 98 and 60.

## Output
The output should include all possible two dart finishes for that number. Trebles should be prefixed with T and doubles with D.

## Sample Input
``` shell
86
```

## Sample Output
``` shell
T20 D10
T18 D16
T16 D19
```
